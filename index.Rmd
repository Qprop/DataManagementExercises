# Data Management Exercise {.tabset}

## Welcome 

This week we are doing exercise, and focus of exercise will be on the three software done during the training.

1. MS Excel
2. R
3. PowerBi

### Data can be fun | Visualization and story telling
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1")

```




### 1. MS Excel

  General use and understanding of Microsoft excel. Maneouvering through workbooks, sheets and formulas.

  Intertwined understanding of how formulas work with sheets across workbooks.

### 2. R Software

  Statistical software used for analysis.

  Work around understanding of what R Software is and familirazation to the IDE RStudio


### 3. PowerBI

  Software tool used for visualization and story telling.

  Creation of dashboards that are fed directly from raw data format.

  Introduction of the interface, use of visuals and how to change functions.

  Understanding of how to manipulate data on the data structure end.


### Overview of our knowledge

* Installation of MS Excel
* Installation of R
* Installation of RStudio
* Installation of PowerBI
* Interface familiarization



### Teaching guide

* Mixed instructional guide, with the presentation but focused on getting more hard skills
* Engagements and practice on the fly

### Datasets

Link to all the datasets we will be using [here](https://github.com/Qprop/DataManagementExercises/tree/master/Data) . Will be accessing my github account for the data

3. Which publisher has the highest number of games


## Day 2 {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Rstudio installation quiz set 
Link to quiz [here](https://qprop.shinyapps.io/instructor_exam/) or see below

We are going to use the day's before datasets but instead of using Excel, we will now use R.

## Day 3 {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Using Inventory data to create a dashboard of our own choice look and feel.

Datasets **Data>inventory_powerbi** two files:

1. categories.csv
2. warm_data.xlsx

### Task 1

1. Prepare clean and explore the dataset to see what it contains using a mix of excel and power query

2. What does the categories data contain

3. What does the warm_data contain

### Task 2

Some of the analysis to be done and not limited to this only, you can pick what is flexible for your case

1. Revenue `Revenue = Quantity of units sold * selling price`
2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) `production costs of the goods`
3. Profit `Profit = COGS - Revenue`

Data structure

![](Images/Dataset table details.png)


Data Table Defintion

![](Images/Table_Definitions.png)

Ensure that data is clean and free from duplicates.


### Task 3

Inventory Control and Management

1. Average Inventory Value `(starting value + Ending value)/2`

2. Inventory Turnover `COGS/ Average Inventory Value`

3. *ABC Analysis  (Optional and needs to be researched) ![](Images/ABC_analysis.png)


Create a new page named "Sales by Year" and visualize;
  - The total quantity of orders by year.
  - The descending rank with the percentages of the top sold products for the the top selling year only



**HINT** All sample results done in the solutions folder


## Day 4 {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Continuation of PowerBI exercises and solutions.


Using the English Premier League data create your own dashboard in any way you would want it to look like.


## Day 5 {.tabset .tabset-pills}


Wrapping up and consolidating what we have learnt and the exercise we have done thus far.

We have noticed the interchange and use of excel, R and Power BI.
Each has its own advantage over the other as well as disadvantages.


*It is all a matter of exercising and practicing, creating your mental memory*

**Finally Q & A**
